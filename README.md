# Project Overview

## Activity Planner App with Node.js and Express

Welcome to our dynamic web application project. We are developing an Activity Planner App using Node.js and Express, integrating the UK Police API, Open Weather API, and postcode finder API. Users select a location and activity, receiving weather data and crime statistics. The ChatGPT API processes this information, producing a concise summary of the weather outlook and potential safety concerns for the chosen activity in the specified area.

### Key Features:
- **User Interaction:** Users have the ability to select a location and an activity of their choice.
- **Data Integration:** The app fetches weather data and crime statistics based on the user's input.
- **ChatGPT Integration:** Leveraging the ChatGPT API, the app processes this information, generating a concise summary of the weather outlook and potential safety concerns for the selected activity in the specified area.

## Learning Opportunity for Junior Developers

As junior developers, this project is an invaluable learning opportunity. It allows us to delve into server-side and client-side development, master API integration techniques, and collaborate effectively on coding tasks.

## Learning Objectives
Our primary learning objectives for this project include:

1. **Node.js and Express Proficiency:** Cultivate a solid understanding of Node.js and Express, crucial components in modern web development.

2. **API Integration Mastery:** Learn to seamlessly integrate data from external APIs, expanding our capacity to work with diverse data sources.

3. **Dynamic Content Generation:** Dive into server-side and client-side techniques for dynamically generating content, enriching the overall user experience.

4. **Effective Collaboration:** Strengthen collaborative skills through shared coding, conflict resolution, and version control using Git.

## Project Setup
- Clone the repository to our local machine.
- Ensure Node.js is installed.
- Run `npm install` to install project dependencies.

## Server-side Development
### Static Web Page
- Create a visually appealing static web page using HTML, CSS, and potentially a templating engine like EJS.
- Use Express to serve the static page.

### JSON Endpoints
- Implement JSON endpoints to facilitate seamless data exchange.
- Leverage Express for handling API requests and responses.

## API Integration
- Study documentation for the UK Police API, Open Weather API, and Postcodes.io API
- Develop functions to query these APIs and extract relevant data.

## Dynamic Content Generation
### Server-side
- Utilize the retrieved data for dynamic server-side content generation.
- Explore various server-side rendering techniques.

### Client-side
- Enhance user interactivity using JavaScript for dynamic client-side content updates.
- Consider incorporating frontend frameworks/libraries for additional functionality.

## Project Deployment
- Deploy the web application on hosting platforms such as Heroku or AWS.
- Document the deployment process for future reference.

## Documentation
- Provide clear and concise documentation for the codebase.
- Include brief explanations of each file's purpose.
- Offer instructions for local application execution.

# Conclusion
Embarking on this exciting journey to develop an Activity Planner App we will learn, code, and create a web application that not only meets our project goals but also expands our skills as junior developers!
